Setup
Environment
Python: 3.11
Torch: 2.4.1

Data
We provied For Training, we use 30k+ pseudo smiles-specturm pairs generated by cfmid (you can download the raw smiles lists file here). For evaluation, we use 300+ real specturm to verify our method (download here). For evaluation in real samples，we use one LC–QTOF dataset for wastewater samples to verify our model (download here, code: gmas).

Model weights
You can find our trained model weights in "models" file.

Training
You can replicate our experiment with default settings, run

python tools/train.py

Evaluation
You can run

python tools/utils_eval.py

Predict real data
We provide an example.py for your reference. You can replace [data path] with your own data for prediction.
